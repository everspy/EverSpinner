# EverSpinner
A simple text spinner for Android

The app parses text and spins it.

Examples:

The quick {brown|white|orange|purple} fox jumps over the lazy {dog|cat}.

Any of the four colors could be chosen as well as dog or cat.

The app can also handle nested sections:
{ A | B | C | {D|E|F} }

In this example, {D|E|F} has a 1 in 4 chance of being selected.
